    <h1>Step 1:</h1>
    <h1>Playing on iOS or PC? Download an Android emulator.</h1>
    <br />
    <span>
      As you may (or may not) know, the Amazon Appstore only works on Android-enabled devices or
      Fire tablets. That means you can’t natively sideload the Amazon Appstore onto your iOS enabled device.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      Fortunately, all you need is an Android emulator to sidestep this obstacle.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      What exactly is an emulator?
    </span>
    <span>
      An emulator is a piece of software that makes it possible to mimic an Android device
      on a computer running macOS or Windows.

    <div class="my_list">
      <p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to www.bignox.com</p>
      <p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Click “Download”</p>
      <p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Once downloaded, open the download file to install the Nox App Player</p>
      <p>
        4. &nbsp; &nbsp;After installation, open the Nox App—note that running the Nox App chews
        through a lot of memory, so be sure to close all other open apps
      </p>

    <h1>Step 2:</h1>
    <h1>Download and install Amazon Appstore using your emulator.</h1>
    <br />
    <span>
      The Amazon Appstore is essential if you want to be able to purchase decks
      and adventures for Hearthstone at a discount.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      Once the Nox App is open, paste the URL below into the navigation bar of
      the browser within the emulator.
    </span>
    <br />
    <div class="field"><span>http://bit.ly/getcoins102</span></div> <!--****PUT BUTTON TO COPY HERE****-->
    <br />

    <h2>How to Download and Install the Amazon Appstore</h2>
    <br />
    <span>
      After following the above URL, click “Get Amazon Underground”. This will prompt
      an .APK file to download onto your emulator.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      (This app is built and distributed by Amazon. It is perfectly safe to run on your device.)
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      When the download is complete, run the .APK file to install the Amazon Appstore.
    </span>
          <hr />

    <h1>Step 3:</h1>
    <h1>Open Amazon Appstore on your emulator, sign-in to your Amazon account, and download Hearthstone.</h1>
    <br />
    <div class="my_list">
      <span>
        Hearthstone should download automatically, but in case it doesn’t, here are instructions to
        download Hearthstone within the emulator:
      </span>
      <br />
      <p>
        1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Sign-in to the Amazon Appstore app through the emulator using your Amazon account
        (if you do not have one, you will need to create one)
      </p>
      <p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Search for “Hearthstone” in the Amazon Appstore app </p>
      <p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Find, select, and install Hearthstone</p>
      <p>
        4. &nbsp; &nbsp;When the installation has finished, open Hearthstone through the Amazon Appstore,
        or through the Nox emulator
      </p>
    </div>
    <img class="step_img" src="../../assets/laptop/Step 3.png"/>
          <hr />

    <h1>Step 4:</h1>
    <h1>With Hearthstone successfully launched, sign-in to your Blizzard Account.</h1>
    <br />
    <span>
      You now have the “Amazon” version of Hearthstone. That means you can now get exclusive
      access to Amazon Coins and complete in-app purchases at a discount.
    </span>
    <img class="step_img" src="../../assets/laptop/Step 4.png"/>
          <hr />

    <h1>Step 5:</h1>
    <h1>Buy card packs and start saving.</h1>
    <br />
    <div class="my_list">
      <span>
        Great! You’re just one step away from using Amazon Coins to start saving on Hearthstone
        card packs and adventures.
      </span>
      <br />
      <p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Hearthstone app, click “Shop”</p>
      <p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Select what you want to purchase and click, “Buy”</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <span>
      Now, when you buy card packs or adventures, you’ll automatically be presented with the
      option to buy Amazon Coins in bulk and save.
    </span>
    <img class="step_img" src="../../assets/laptop/Step 5.png"/>
    <span>
      The best part? You only need to complete the purchase in the emulator-you don't have to play
      in the emulator.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      Because your purchases will be automatically tied to your Blizzard account, you can log out of
      Hearthstone on the emulator, log back in using your preferred iOS device, and continue playing as usual.
