    <h1>Step 1:</h1>
    <h1>Uninstall the Google Play version of Hearthstone from your Android device.</h1>
    <br />
    <span>
      You don't have to worry about losing any of your Hearthstone data, because Blizzard automatically
      syncs your in-game progress and purchases on its servers. That way, whenever you log back in you can
      resume playing right where you left off regardless of the device you're playing on.
    </span>
    <br />
    <span>
      Note: This will NOT work unless you uninstall the Google Play version of Hearthstone.
      Amazon Coins are only available on Hearthstone when the game is downloaded through
      the Amazon Appstore.
    </span>
    <br />
    <div class="my_list">
      <span>To Uninstall Hearthstone:</span>
      <p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Open the Hearthstone app</p>
      <p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Open the in-app "Settings"</p>
      <p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Select "Switch Accounts"</p>
      <p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;You will be asked "Are You Sure?" Click "Yes"</p>

      The Amazon Appstore is essential if you want if you want to be able to purchase decks and
      adventures for Hearthstone at a discount. Please be aware this app is not available through
